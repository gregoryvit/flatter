Faced with similar problem?

Until [Apple not fix it](http://www.openradar.me/35879960) I made some solution for workaround this problem - flatter!

Flatter is a gem which move all swift files in xCode project to root group. That's all :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xcflatter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xcflatter

## Usage

Simple

    $ flatter "/path/to/your/project.xcodeproj"

Specific group

    $ flatter "/path/to/your/project.xcodeproj" -g "SpecificGroup"

Advanced

    $ flatter "/path/to/your/project.xcodeproj" -g "SpecificGroup" -e ".xib"
